# Image Classification
**_Training  Machine learning model on the EuroSAT land cover classification dataset_**


**CONSTRAINTS**

* Model's inability to learn complicated features or underfitting may be caused by a lack of layers and nodes.
* The model's capacity to generalize to different datasets may be constrained by the fact that they were developed using only one dataset (EuroSAT).
* The models are trained for a set number of epochs, which might not be enough to achieve their full potential.


**IMPROVEMENTS**

* To boost the performance of the models, add more layers and nodes to make them deeper and more complicated.

* To improve feature extraction and classification from larger datasets, apply transfer learning to pre-trained models.

* Early stopping can be used to avoid overfitting and obtain peak performance without needing to train for a set number of epochs.

* Use methods like cross-validation to enhance the models' accuracy and prevent bias brought on by the selection of the train-test split.

* To combine many models for improved accuracy and resilience, use ensemble learning.
